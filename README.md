# swiftplay-analysis
Swiftplay KPI Analysis for MDC's Winter 2025 Project with Riot. Our two main hypotheses are:
1. Swiftplay should appeal to players looking for an accelerated, low-stakes, and fair gaming experience
2. Swiftplay should prepare players for “real” games by encouraging them to gain experience with champions

Our analysis is centered around three main categories:
1. Player Fairness & Competitive Balance
2. Game Speed & Duration
3. Player Enjoyment & Retention
